## Algorithm
  - A precise, unambiguous, and correct set of procedures for solving general problems.
#### Why take the class?
  - Computer Networking uses graph Algorithms
  - Bioinformatics use Dynamic Programming Algorithms
  - Cryptography - Number Theoretic Algorithms
  - Abstract away the idea of worrying about how fast something is based on the Processor, or compiler.   

```
Sum  = 0 ---> C
for i = 1 to n  --> Nc
  for j = i to n --> N(N+1)/2
    sum = sum + (i * j)

    So c + Nc + N(N+1)/2 + 2c = n^2
```
Insertion Sort
Best Case: It's already sorted, so O(n) = 1
Worst Case: It's in reverse order, so O(n) = n^2

### Runtime Depends on the input
  -  Always focus on the worse case analysis, it will give the bounds for all possible inputs
  - Average cases?
    - Unlikely, because you won't really ever know what the average input will ever look like
  - Best cases?
    - Never really happens


### Constant factors`
  - 2n vs 3n ---> Doesn't really matter
  - Lower Order Terms
    - 2n^2 + 2n vs 3n^2
      - Drop the 2n
  - Only focus for extreme sizes of N


# I should take notes in html and just embed photos and tables in there and throw it on Harvey

### Merge Sort vs Insertion Sort
  - Merge
    - 6n log2n + 6n
  - Insertion
    - 1/2 n^2

# Big O notation

We say that f(n) = O(g(n))
  - f(n) is bounded above by a constant multiple of g(n)
  - Meaning: f(n) grows no faster than g(n)

## Formal Definition
  f(n) = O(g(n)) if and only if there exists constants c, n0 such that f(n) < cg(n)
