### What is an Operating System?
  - It's a program that sits between apps and the computer hardware

## Goals of an Operating System
  - Universal
    - Provide a interface to hardware resources
    - Maximize the utilization of hardware
    - Solve Contention between requests/resources
  - Common goals
    - Security
      - Protect against buggy application and their crashes
      - control the access to the data on the computer
    - Support software development
    - Provide standard software libraries

### Random Definitions
  - Program
    - A stored Algorithm in the HD
  - Process

  - Process and thread management
    - Starting/loading a new program
    - Ending a process
    - debugging
  - File I/O
    - Organize bits into structures like files/folders
    - Provide interface to file I/O
  - Communicate with external devices
  - Interprocess Communication (ICP)
    - Signals, pipes, & Sockets (TCP/IP)
      - Includes between 2 different computers
  - Process management
    - Deal with the contention between programs and processes gracefully

## Interacting with the OS
#### Via command line or a GUI
  - Programs
    - via functions
      - System calls
      - API functions
    - via networks
      - Connection based
      - Message based
