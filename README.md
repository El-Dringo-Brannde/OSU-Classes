#  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK 

-------------

### A collection of all the classes I have taken from Oregon State University between 2015-2018. 

#### The reason for keeping this open source and available is to _inspire_ others on how to start their homework assignments. I don't believe that sitting in front of the computer spinning one's wheels through trial and error will make you any better of a programmer. Learning from others is what computers science is all about, copying is *NOT*. If you copy my work, accredit me appropriately through comments. *DO NOT* try to copy code from Github, you'll fork the project and then I'll report you to OSU for trying to straight plaigarize my work. 


### Again, use appropriately, and at your own risk.
