        <h1>Why Testing Matters</h1>
        <li id="mainLI"> Disney's Lion King PC game in 1994 </li>
        <ul>
            <li> Developers only tested game on their system, and didn't account for various computer configurations </li>
        </ul>
        <li id="mainLI"> NASA Mars Polar Lander 1999 </li>
        <ul>
            <li> A single bit was probably tripped when the legs came out for landing
                <li> Therefore the Lander already thought it landed and didn't deploy any thrusters or parachutes </li>
                <li> It was tested by a team, but they reset the computer to switch the bit back before actually testing it with the legs down </li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li id="mainLI"> Testing vs Static Analysis </li>
        <ul>
            <li> Static Analysis </li>
            <ul>
                <li> Examining a programs source code without executing it. </li>
                <li> Sort of happens when a compiler goes through your program before making executable </li>
                <li> Could give a false positive by warning about a potential problem that wouldn't show up when running </li>
                <li> There are static analsis programs to check Java programs </li>
                <li> Static analysis may be able to find small bugs, but generally checks the software does what it is supposed to do. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li id="mainLI"> Testing occurs at every level of the sofware development lifecycle <img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pKZlqDYnf7I/TsUXVFl_ADI/AAAAAAAAAF4/IQXvPbVoF-M/s1600/testing+a+software+V+model.jpg" width="500" /> </li>
        <ul>
            <li> Although exhaustive testing is impossible there multi billion possibilities to test </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Of course a bug is cheaper and easier to fix the sooner it is found and rectified</h2>
        <h3>RIP Model</h3>
        <li> Reachability -> Infection(Causes curropt state) -> Propagation(Reliably causes error) </li> <br /><br /><br />
