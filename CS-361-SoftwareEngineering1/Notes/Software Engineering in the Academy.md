## Software engineering is not programming
- It is `“the development of possibly large systems intended for use in production environments, over a possibly long period, worked on by possibly many people, and
possibly undergoing many changes,” `
  - Not all might agree on definition, but all respect importance
- A good and bad developer can be up to 20x difference

### Texas requires software dev licensing?
  - Supported by Parnas

### Goals of a curriculum
  -  Principles and lasting concepts
  - Practices on problem solving techniques
  - Application of some of these techniques that fit best
  - Tools that fit the problem best
  - Math the basis lets you understand everything else

## What a software Dev knows
- Abstraction/Information hiding
- Recursion
- Reusability
- Battling complexity
- Scaling
- Designing for future change
- OO
- Contracts of a function
- Exception handling
- Debugging

## Applications
 - Use whatever will work best for the current problem at hand

## Tools
  - The tools needed for one project need to be open to anything not just one programming language or technology

# Math
- Theory of programming languages isn't that great
- But the ability to reason with math logic is

### Teach by doing
- Possible projects of starting a project and having it taken over by next year
- Inverted Curriculum
  - Use tools as clients then see how they work under the hood
  - Add an extension to an existing project

- While academia might not be doing anything revolutional like inventing the OS, it still teaches vital skills. To be used later on bigger revolutionary things
- And while they might not be able to work on Component based development it should focus on quality
