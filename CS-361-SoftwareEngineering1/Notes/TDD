Largely the paper on TDD just talked about how to use TDD, which for the love of god..
I do 

But one thing to pull away from the paper was to make each increment only 5 lines long roughly. 

Also, you must remember to think of a test to fail before writing code to make the test pass. 
  It is very redlight greenlight
  
Think -> Redlight -> Greenlight -> Refactor -> repeat
