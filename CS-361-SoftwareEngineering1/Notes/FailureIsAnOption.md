# Based off the Space Shuttle Crash
  - Engineers create things,
    - Science just tries to explain it
  - Engineers spend most of their time imagining ways they might fail
  
## During times of failure
   - Engineers become scientists
     - Studying how their system failed

# No one knows better why a system failed other than the Engineers that designed it
