# Running away from risk has no benefit
- If a project has no risk, don't do it
- Merill Lynch never adopted direct trading until LATE
  - E-Trade, took the risk, and exploded

# Metaphor 
- Think of a risky project as someone running up an elevator, once you get to the top you get to control how fast it runs from there

# Proper risk mitigation is simply starting early.
