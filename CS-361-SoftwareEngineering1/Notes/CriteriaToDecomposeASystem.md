# Benefits of modular programming
  - Development time should be shortened with diff. teams working on diff. modules
  - Flexibility b/w modules
  - Comprehensibility in studying one module at a time

# Modularization
  - Responsibility assignment rather than a subprogram
  - Flowcharts are the basic step, but in the end wrong

# Hierarchical structure and clean decomposition are two different properties

# Conclusion
  - Begin with a list of difficult design decesions.
    - Then try to hide this decesion from the others, make it isolationable
  - In the end you just want collections of code all pieced together from separate modules
