# Software Engineering
  - Until about now most work has been programming not SE
  - Study of building reliable programs
    - Differentiates of just programming
  - Process and methodology of software systems
    - Difference from programming
      - Systems
      - methodology
      - Process
  - Development of systems for use in production environments
  - Resilient systems in hostile environments
  - Management of junk
  - Architecture, mapping types of software systems
  - In programming requirements are a given, in SE you have to produce them
  - SE is managing more and more complex abstractions
  - Programming is when you can understand the program, SE is when you have no clue how it works
