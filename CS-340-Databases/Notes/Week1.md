A DBMS should be able to handle multiple users at once and allow them to
Retrieve, alter, or access the data in the database.


## User types of a DB
#### Actors on the scene
 - Database administrators, Database designers (Maintenance, design, control etc)
#### Actors behind the scene
- System designers, Tool developers, Maintenance


#### End users
 - Casual: access DB occasionally
 - naive: power users (mobile people)
 - Sophisticated: Know limits of DB and rely on packages that use DB
 - Stand alone: Use DB internally that doesn't really connect from outside network, Tax programs, media files
